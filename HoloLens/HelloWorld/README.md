This sample shows a trivial HoloLens application, it creates a very simple 
[Node](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Urho.Node) with a Cube.

The cube is placed in the [scene](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Urho.Scene) which becomes
visible into the user's world.

By using `UrhoAppView` in your main program, we connect the HoloLens Camera and configure the
world for you.
